# Advice Generator 
#### A challenge from FrontendMentor

This is my solution to the [Advice Generator App on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). It's my first ever challenge taken and although it's fairly simple, I enjoyed making it :grin:. I've made some minor changes though, I used the Poppins fonts instead of the Manrope and added a "Getting advice..." loading when fetching the data from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).
